# =============
#
# Assignment 1
# ------------
#
# The objective of this assignment is to learn about simple data curation practices, and familiarize you with some of the data we'll be reusing later.
#
# This notebook uses the [notMNIST](http://yaroslavvb.blogspot.com/2011/09/notmnist-dataset.html) dataset to be used with python experiments. This dataset is designed to look like the classic [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset, while looking a little more like real data: it's a harder task, and the data is a lot less 'clean' than MNIST.

# In[7]:

# These are all the modules we'll be using later. Make sure you can import them
# before proceeding further.

Later we'll merge them into a single dataset of manageable size.

# Problem 5
# ---------
#
# By construction, this dataset might contain a lot of overlapping samples, including training data that's also contained in the validation and test set! Overlap between training and test can skew the results if you expect to use your model in an environment where there is never an overlap, but are actually ok if you expect to see training samples recur when you use it.
# Measure how much overlap there is between training, validation and test samples.
#
# Optional questions:
# - What about near duplicates between datasets? (images that are almost identical)
# - Create a sanitized validation and test set, and compare your accuracy on those in subsequent assignments.
